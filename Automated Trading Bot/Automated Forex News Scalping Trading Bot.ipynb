    "Imagine that we are presented with the oldest bet in the book, a coinflip. When the coin is in the air, we have no way of knowing whether the coin will land on heads, or tails.  \n",

    "Well, then we could say, with a 100% certainty, that at that exact point in time the coin's state will be either heads or tails. And we see that this is what is happening in the forex market, as countries' economic news are always released at a pre-specified time. For example, non-farm payrolls, which is one of the most closely monitored forex news is always released at 2030 hrs (SGT) on the first Friday of every month. These news events often bring volatility, and more importantly, it may cause a strong candle to form due to mass buying/ selling if the result is extremely unexpected.  \n",
    "As shown, the news are always released at a predictable time:"

    "Note that what matters here is that the result must be significantly different from the **consensus**; it does not matter in terms of the value of the result itself. For example, assume that the US economy has been doing relatively poorly and the estimates for the NFP is at 1360K, down from 4800K last month as shown above. If the actual results show 2000K, the market would still be **bullish** on USD even though it is down from 4800K, whereas an upset to the downside at 1000K would potentially cause a huge **bearish** candle, off of which we could capitalize on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the strategy here is:\n",
    "1. Place both a buy stop and a sell stop at a certain number of pips above and below the current price two minutes prior to news strike (S/L: current price).\n",
    "2. If the result is not significantly different from the consensus, close off both positions.\n",
    "3. If the buy stop is triggered, close the sell stop position and trail the stop loss. Vice versa if sell stop is triggered.\n",

    "The strategy is implemented using Darwinex's API, which is built on the ZeroMQ Connector to MT4. The reason why this API is chosen is mainly because of flexibility; as this API allows us to choose from any broker that uses MT4 as it is built upon MQL4. Thus, we would be able to choose for example, Pepperstone as our broker as their flat commission rate structure instead of a bid-ask spread would allow us to avoid the potentially higher bid-ask spread during the news strike time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, the API works by connecting external scripts in other languages such as Python to MT4 through synchronous and asynchronous messaging using Expert Advisors MQL4 script. For further details, please refer to Darwinex's github: https://github.com/darwinex/dwx-zeromq-connector"
