# Algorithmic Trading Projects
Contact: zhilun296@gmail.com  

Hello and welcome to my repository! I apologize if any of the presentation/nomenclature of variables/documentation etc is not proper as I am self taught and still new to this, however, I sincerely hope that this will suffice as proof that I have gotten my feet wet with algorithmic trading and that I am willing to learn.  

Please let me know if you have any questions. Any guidance or feedback would be truly appreciated. Thank you so much!  


Included in the repo are some examples of the projects that I have worked on in my spare time:

## 1. Data Handling
In practice, the raw data files need to be cleaned and parsed before it can be used for purposes such as backtesting. This file shows the method used to clean and handle raw 1 minute OHLC data.

## 2. Automated Trading Bot
This file discusses an automated trading bot I wrote for a simple strategy, which is scalping the forex news.

## 3. Backtesting with Backtrader
Backtrader is a library that aims to streamline the backtesting process. This file shows some sample strategies that I backtested with backtrader.

## 4. Backtesting with Pandas
This project was conceived as when working in a corporate actuarial environment, often times projections are cross checked using two or even more methods, e.g. one in actuarial software (e.g. Prophet) and another one in Excel. I believe using multiple methods to cross check adds value, especially if I am serious about taking the strategy live. Thus this file shows a basic backtesting framework to check against backtrader, built in pandas.

## 5. Data Collection
This is a short project aimed to show how minute level data can be collected from Alpha Vantage.
